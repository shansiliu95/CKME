This is the official repository of CKME.

Our codes are tested with numpy 1.19.5, anndata 0.7, and scikit-learn 1.0.

Please follow train.py to prepare dataset, transform data into random fourier feature space, use kernel herding to subselect cells and finlly compute mean embedding vectors for classification. We also show how to compute a score for every cell in a sample-set.
